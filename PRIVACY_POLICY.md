## FACE DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

WearWise processes user-uploaded portrait photographs for virtual try-on functionality.

What Face Data We Collect:
• User-uploaded portrait photographs which may include facial features
• Photos are used as a whole image canvas for virtual clothing overlay
• We do NOT extract facial landmarks, biometric identifiers, or facial recognition profiles
• We do NOT analyze or store specific facial geometry or measurements

Precise Technical Processing:
• Your portrait photo is sent as a complete image to our AI service for virtual try-on generation
• The AI service overlays clothing items onto your photo using image processing techniques
• No facial feature extraction, landmark detection, or biometric analysis occurs
• The photo serves purely as a visual canvas for clothing placement

Planned Uses of Face Data:
• Exclusively to allow users to visualize clothing items overlaid on their uploaded photograph
• To create realistic virtual try-on images by placing clothing onto the portrait
• Your photo is processed as a whole image without facial feature analysis
• Face data is NOT used for identification, advertising, user profiling, facial recognition, or any purpose outside of virtual clothing overlay

Third-Party Processing (fal.ai):
• Complete portrait photos (which may contain faces) are sent to fal.ai for AI-powered virtual try-on generation
• fal.ai processes images ephemerally during try-on generation and does not retain them permanently

Data Retention Period:
• Original portrait photos: Retained as long as your account is active or until you delete the specific photo
